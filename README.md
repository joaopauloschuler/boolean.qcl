# Quantum Logic Operations and Graph Coloring
Repository for the paper "Quantum Logic Operations and Graph Coloring". This 2001 paper represents a significant early contribution to practical quantum computing, demonstrating remarkable foresight in addressing the challenges of quantum programming.

## Abstract
This paper introduces notions of quantum computing such as qubit, quantum entanglement and probability amplitudes. Further on introducing physical aspects about quantum computing, this paper proposes a simple method for implementing the logic operations AND and OR based on the logic operation CNot. The source code exemples are coded in Quantum Computing Language (QCL). This paper also shows a way to test if a graph is 3-colorable using QCL.

## Technical Innovation
The paper introduces practical implementations of fundamental logic operations (AND, OR, NAND, NOR) using CNot gates, expanding QCL's capabilities through the boolean.qcl library. It also presents a quantum solution for the NP-complete graph 3-coloring problem, demonstrating quantum parallelism's potential.

## Educational Impact
The work provides an accessible bridge between classical and quantum computing paradigms, offering clear explanations of quantum concepts alongside practical implementations. This approach remains valuable for modern quantum computing education.

## Methodological Advancement
The paper establishes a fundamental pattern for quantum algorithm development: generating all possible solutions in superposition and then selecting valid ones through quantum operations. This approach has proven influential in quantum algorithm design.
Most notably, the paper demonstrates remarkable prescience in addressing practical quantum programming challenges that remain relevant today, making it a foundational work in quantum software development.
